# C-Age
An Age Determining program made in C++
Welcome to my first Open Project! 
This is something I've been messing around with for about a week now, and I hope to make it better.

I am still learning some thing with C++, so this is just a little project I made to see my code develop and grow with me.
I hope to learn more things and to add to this as I move along. 

I plan on having some more features implemented, such as when age milestones are made in a year.
(You could drive in 2010)

Feel free to alter the code a bit and show me your ideas. 

(Note, everything I do is done on a C++ Shell on a Chromebook)
